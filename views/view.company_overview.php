	<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
	<p>The purpose of our company is to allow those who might not yet be "professional" photographers to upload their content and make some income off of it. Other stock photography websites require a lengthy vetting process before you're even approved to upload anything to their site, their payout schemes are ambigous and not straight forward at all. Everything here at sharefuly is simplified for both the contributors as well as the customers buying images.</p>
	<p>We've given you the ability to downvote or upvote a particular tag on any image to help with keeping the seartch results relevant to the subject you're looking for.</p>
	<p> Coming Soon: Support to upload fonts, icon sets, and SVGs</p>
