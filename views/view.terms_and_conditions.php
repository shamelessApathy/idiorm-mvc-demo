	<h5>Selling Your Content</h5>
	<p>
	What you are selling is a license to use your content, which is explained in greater detail below. The buyer (“Buyer”) does not have the right to then post your content on the Site and present it as his or her own. </p>

	<h5>Purchasing Content</h5>
	<p>The Buyer who purchases content on Sharefuly is purchasing a license to use the content, explained below. The purchase price is a licensing fee, which grants the Buyer the right to use the content but does not grant title to the Buyer. Buyers may not sell or assign this license to third parties. Buyers can access all of their purchased images on the website, but access to these images is not guaranteed.</p>

	<h5>License</h5>
	<p>This is a license to use our Site. Sharefuly gives you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicensable license to access the Site on the condition that you abide by these Terms. You and other users do not have unlicensed access. Sharefuly remains the sole owner of all right, title, and interest in the Site and reserves all rights not expressly granted under these Terms of Use. You cannot license, distribute, make derivative works, display, sell, or frame content from Sharefuly, with the exception of content that you create and share with friends or family.</p>

	<p>By posting content, you grant Sharefuly a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, or store it. You allow us to use your images for the purpose of advertising and promotion of this Site. Users also agree to grant Buyers a perpetual, irrevocable license upon payment of the agreed upon purchase price, or licensing fee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely.</p>

	<h5>Payment Terms and What We Charge to Sell Your Content</h5>
	<p>Sharefuly uses Square, Inc. or PayPal® and only uses U.S. Dollars. To make purchases or collect licensing fees, you must have a valid Square or PayPal® account on file. Payments will be made on a NET30+7 time schedule. This means that Sharefuly has 30 days from the end of the payment month after an item was purchased plus 7 days to deposit funds into your account. We will try to pay you as quickly as possible, but this ensures that you get all of the payments that you have earned. Final payment amounts may differ from the purchase tracking user page.</p>

	<p>Sharefuly charges a listing fee, which will only be charged when you sell an item. You authorize us to collect a listing fee as a percentage of each sale that you make. The listing fee is 10% of the listed purchase price for each item. You can list an item for any amount and for whatever you believe that it is worth. For example, if you sell an item that you listed for $10.00, you will collect $9.00, and Sharefuly will collect $1.00. If you sell an item that you listed for $1,000.00, you will collect $900.00, and Sharefuly will collect $100.00.</p>

	<p>Buyers will be charged a $0.30 fee for any purchases under $10.00. </p>

	<h5>Subscriptions</h5>

Sharefuly is committed to protecting your intellectual property rights.  You assume all responsibility for the content that you upload. In the event that a copyright infringement claim is filed against you, your image(s) will be disabled until you authenticate and prove that the image is yours.
